## UX Design

### The Strategy Plane

For this project I've decided to delve into forbidden  waters of the gambling world. It's a massive industry
netting $450B a year globaly and is on a trajectory to hit $1T befor 2030. My focus is to replicate a live casino-style blackjack game, while incorporating all the befenitial features of an online game. The value I wish to provide to the user is a platform where one can learn the game without investing any money, witness potential win/loss rates and hopefully reduce, minimise or completely eliminate one's loses. Idealy this website will educate one on the ins and outs of the game and discourage them from playing and losing their hard earned money.

#### Problem Statement

There isn't a free and competent online environment that would enable one to learn the game of blackjack and practice playing live casino-style game to the hearts contempt, while simultaniously providing usefull information like win rate. Anyone looking to to do so  will generally be faced with 2 options: a formal online casino website or a downloadable game/ some individuals project work. Drawbacks of these options are listed below.

#### Competitor Analysis

I've done an analysis of existing competitors. Me being a user of a number of online casino websites over the years I have aquired quite in depth knowledge of how the game of blackjack is played there. I also browsed a number of repositories and tried a few downloadable games. These are my observations:

##### Formal online casinos:
- Require user to register or create an account
- Require bank card details in some cases
- While some have an option to play with 'play chips' that are free, however they are limited in most cases
- The apperance and functionality is good, but lacking an option to display certain factors (like true count) that would increase players chances to win
- Digital shuffle of the cards works against the player
- Live dealer option with real cards is much slower
- The environment itself is distracting and might lead you to playing other games.

##### Downloadable games/ individual repositories:
- Downloadable games have to be downloaded and in some cases from unknown sources
- The functionality of these are questionable at best
- Will have issues with randomness of the cards
- In many cases even basic features are missing
- In most cases there's no way of tracking your score or win rate.
- Might be suitable for learning the basic, but not for someone looking to learned advanced stuff

#### Target Audience 

Simos-Blackjack is for anyone looking to learn the game of blackjack or expand their knowledge and improve their strategy. From a compleat novice to a pro who's on a quest to take the casinos for all they got, everyone will find something of benefit on this website.
